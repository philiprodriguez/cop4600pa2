Okay so this is pretty simple. Running make will compile and create the ko file for the test\_device.c file. You also need to gcc the test\_user\_program.c file. Then, use sudo insmod on the ko file to install the kernel module. Use dmesg to see if it succeeded. Then, run the user program as sudo. It hopefully will work. Then use sudo rmmod on the ko file to remove the kernel module. Thats all there is to this!
